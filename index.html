				<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
				<div class="des">
					<p></p>
					I am a programmer/Web Developer in the Los Angeles area.  My areas of focus are developing website designs from image templates, building applications for SQL database retrieval, designing databases, and maintaining the overall applications of websites. <br />
					I am a self learner, and I have taught myself most of the Web Development programming languages and technologies that I know so far.<br />
					I may not have much work experience but I have done some projects that have come out well, and they are all stored in my github account(I will give out upon request).  If you are looking for someone with a lot of work experience(4+ years) and be an expert in every CMS, framework and other tools that contribute little to productivity, then please look elsewhere unless are willing to train people with little experience.  I am willing to do a couple of day's work for free(about a week) so clients can determine if I am fit for this position.  Those days do not have to be paid whether I am hired or not.

				<h1>GOALS</h1>
					<div class="des">
						<p></p>
						I want to learn more about programming and creating web applications for people to use.<br />
						My current goals are to learn Ruby/Ruby on Rails, Andriod/iOS App Development, deploying applications to the internet from home, and basically everything that I can to improve my skills on web development and web applications.
